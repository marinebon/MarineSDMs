## Background

The best available global distributions are presently AquaMaps [@kaschner2006; @ready2010] with supplementation by IUCN RedList range maps[^index-1]. These have been used to calculate the biodiversity within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) [@halpern2012] as well as beyond in the high seas [@visalli2020].

## Goals

This book is meant to capture the overview and details of modeling species distributions in the marine environment for the purposes of advancing the status quo of global and U.S. national species distributions along the following dimensions:

1.  **Space**\
    The current AquaMaps distributions are ${1}/{2}$ยบ (\~55 km at equator), whereas the best available global bathymetry is ${1}/{240}$ยบ (\< 0.5 km).

2.  **Time**\
    The current AquaMaps distributions are based on static climatic averages over all seasons, which does not capture temporal dynamics: seasonally within a year, nor long-term climate change trends. This will necessitate sampling the environment contemporaneously with species observations before fitting the model and predicting to different environmental snapshots.

3.  **Environment**\
    Other environmental variables besides the initial physiographic (depth) and oceanographic (temperature, chlorophyll, primary productivity and ice) may elicit an improved statistical fit, related to species' environmental niche. Some candidates include: temperature fronts, eddy kinetic energy, distance from shore, distance from shelf.

4.  **Biology**\
    Where sufficient observations exist, additional models should be developed highlighting differences between:

    -   **Life stage**, e.g. larval vs adult.

    -   **Gender** where varies, such as male sperm whales being more cosmopolitan.

    -   **Subpopulations** for understanding metapopulation dynamics

    -   **Behavior**, such as migrating, feeding or breeding.

By definition `r glossary("MBON")` is a network, so this is inclusive of and meant for all participants.

## Motivations

-   [AquaMaps.org](https://aquamaps.org/)\
    AquaMaps [@kaschner2006; @ready2010] represents a massive amount of work to gather parameters for \>33.5K marine species, including areas to mask out.

-   [OBIS.org](OBIS.org)\
    The Ocean Biogeographic Information System [@klein2019; @grassle2000]is the central portal for continuously added observations with extra flags for quality control, all of which makes marine SDMs possible.

-   **Modeling** methods have dramatically improved over time and are ripe for fresh application. The R package `dismo` originally came came out with an [SDM vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/vignettes/sdm.pdf) as a practical supplement to their excellent review of SDMs [@elith2009] and using the Maxent algorithm [@elith2011]. The raster package furthered that (raster[ sdm](https://rspatial.org/raster/sdm/)) and now there's [`terra` sdm](https://rspatial.org/sdm/). Alongside these developments has been a boon of cloud-computing, particularly Google Earth Engine [@gorelick2017; @camposEcologicalNicheModels2023], allowing for dense global raster processing.

-   The world is quickly moving towards a future trying to conserve 30% of the oceans by 2030, so called "[**30 by 30**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_by_30)". In the U.S., this is [America the Beautiful](https://www.noaa.gov/america-the-beautiful) initiative. We need biodiversity indicators to track progress. This push for conservation is driven by increasing impacts of **climate change**, as evidenced by marine heatwaves and shifts in population distributions.
