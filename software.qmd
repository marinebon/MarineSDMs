## R

Most packages have not yet migrated from using the deprecated `raster` R package to the new `terra` package, except for [`biomod2`](https://biomodhub.github.io/biomod2/) (ref?).

-   [`biomod2`](https://biomodhub.github.io/biomod2/)\
    *Species distribution modeling, calibration and evaluation, ensemble modeling\

-   [`eks`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eks/vignettes/tidysf_kde.html)\
    *Tidy and Geospatial Kernel Smoothing for spatially filtering outlier observations*

-   [`predicts`](Species%20distribution%20modeling,%20calibration%20and%20evaluation,%20ensemble%20modeling)\
    *New R library using terra for predicting from fitted model*

## Python

-   [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/)\
    Xarray makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays in Python simple, efficient, and fun!

## Google Earth Engine

-   [XEE](https://github.com/google/Xee)\
    XEE is a new Python package for Earth Engine that provides a set of functions to facilitate the use of Earth Engine API. It is designed to be used in Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab. [Documentation](https://google.github.io/Xee/)
