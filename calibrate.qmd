The process of refining the model to only the most relevant environmental predictor terms is commonly called "Model Selection." One of the most cited scientific paper of all time [@akaike1974] is based on taking a most parsimonious approach to this process -- the so called Akaike Information Criteria (AIC).

It is important to avoid using environmental predictors that are correlated with each other, since the effect of a predictor on the response could be the ecologically inverse, the result of explaining variance on the residuals of the other correlated predictor.
