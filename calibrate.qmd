# Calibrate

The process of refining the model to only the most relevant environmental predictor terms is commonly called "Model Selection." One of the most cited scientific paper of all time [@akaike1974] is based on taking a most parsimonious approach to this process -- the so called Akaike Information Criteria (AIC).

It is important to avoid using environmental predictors that are correlated with each other, since the effect of a predictor on the response could be the ecologically inverse, the result of explaining variance on the residuals of the other correlated predictor.

## Predict

The prediction step applies the environmental relationships from the fitted model to a new set of data, typically the seascape of interest, and perhaps with some sort of temporal snapshot (e.g., climatic annual or monthly average).

## Evaluate

Model evaluation uses the set aside test data from the earlier splitting to evaluate how well the model predicts the response of presence or absence. Since the test response data is binary \[0,1\] and the prediction from the model is continuous \[0-1\], a threshold needs to be applied to assign to convert the continuous response to binary. This is often performed through a Receiver Operator Characteristic (**ROC**) curve (@fig-rocr), which evaluates at each threshold the **confusion matrix** (@tbl-confusion-matrix).
