Can we supplement an existing portal or create a new one to host different types of model outputs and combine them?

What standards [@ara√∫jo2019; @kass2023; @zurell2020] are required for models to be hosted?

-   Existing SDM portals
    -   [AquaMaps](https://aquamaps.org/)
        *Standardized distribution maps for over 33,500 species of fishes, marine mammals and invertebrates*
    -   [DisMAP](https://apps-st.fisheries.noaa.gov/dismap/)\
        *Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal*
    -   [OBIS-SEAMAP Model Repository](https://seamap.env.duke.edu/models/)\
        *World Data Center for Marine Mammal, Seabird, Sea Turtle, Shark & Ray Distributions*
-   Candidate portal\
    [MarineSpeciesMaps.org](MarineSpeciesMaps.org) \
    BDB registered the domain. Similar to:
    -   **MarineRegions.org**\
        *spatial authority*
    -   **MarineSpecies.org**\
        *taxonomic authority*
