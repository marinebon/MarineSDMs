## All background

A common Maxent strategy is to feed all background points into Maxent, and then to use the resulting distribution as a null model. This is the default strategy in Maxent [@phillips2017; @phillips2006; @phillips2008].

## Mask by FAO areas

The FAO areas applicable to species are included in the `aquamapsdata`, presumably from evaluating OBIS observations and the literature.

## Use occurrences from same Family, different species

By using the same family, we can be sure that the pseudo-absences are ecologically similar to the species of interest.
